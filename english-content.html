I will write quite briefly and very generally and will not go into details. If there is more interest, feel free to contact us via Q-Mail / Q-Chat without being shy<br><br>My life changed completely 15.12.2021 Until that date, I was probably a completely normal and similar person who went to work, lived in a rented apartment and other routines that belong to such a life.<br><br>I can also count this date as a very important anniversary in my life and is definitely worth celebrating like St. John's Day or Christmas. Namely, after that date, big, big changes started to happen in my life, I became homeless and unemployed, but what happened next is only pure positive joy and freedom. I escaped the slavery of the system.<br><br>I am free and I decide and am fully responsible for my own life, no one else does because they have no right to do so. You who are a CITIZEN of a country, have this passport or some other identification document, then you are a SLAVE and your life is decided by that same country whose citizen are you.<br><br>The real picture of the whole world began to gradually open up to me just when this corona "killer virus" appeared, I began to understand more and more subtly and skilfully how this whole big fraud scheme in humanity is built and how the enslavement of humanity takes place in this systemic world . I began to perceive it more and more and continue to see and feel it everywhere every day. Thanks to this fraud "corona", my job and residence were cleverly stolen, they wanted to make me obey them...-I managed to tear myself out of this system... I am still very happy about all this, that it all just happened that way. I am seriously thankful from the bottom of my heart to the citizen who came up with this idea.<br><br>All this circus fortunately opened my eyes at the right time - otherwise I would continue to be a citizen of the system, a slave with an identity document - a free person does not have to prove anything to anyone. I would work day in and day out for someone else's well-being and to get rich and have a beautiful life, completely forgetting my own life, well-being, health... completely in return for all this to survive with a few bucks worth nothing. This is not life, 95% of your life you waste for someone else's welfare.<br><br>Citizens are the property of the system (state)!!! All countries are registered companies, citizens are contractual customers of the system. Contracts create obligations and they must be fulfilled, YOU fulfill them because you are bound to the system with the contracts. The clauses of the contract are the law. You can freely search the DNB database records by country.<br><br>During the corona, a lot of different information from the DNB database started to be hidden/changed, as it was also done elsewhere on the internet, for example on wikipedias and other websites containing the original true information, because people would understand the nonsense that was happening, conspiracy theories started to come true...but that's just yet the beginning, we are at the foot of the iceberg, the worst is yet to come, but it seems that we cannot stop it anymore. Citizens have been intimidated, lured into a "comfortable" life, citizens do not dare to oppose their "master" because he has a fictional system bank loan, house, car, etc. bought on credit. If you stand against the master, you will lose all of this and your life will be turned into dust.<br><br>States have cheated people of everything. Land, forests, lakes, mineral resources, all of which belong equally to all of us, not to countries. Ask yourself a question - from whom has the state bought or received permission to only legally manage them? I would also like to see that confirmation.<br><br>All people are equal - no person has the right to command/force another person to do anything - no right to judge/accuse another person. People mostly live according to two basic ideas - do not intentionally harm others and do not damage/appropriate other people's property. Citizens need hundreds of pages of long prescriptions (laws) when it comes to behaving in order to please the lord. Humans don't need them! A person does not have to PROVE anything to anyone!<br><br>Such are the differences between a person and a CITIZEN, written in a general way. Which one do you want to be? - I am and live a human life</p><hr class="separator separator--dots"><h2 id="what-kind-of-world-i-am-creating-for-myself-or-where-i-want-to-live">what kind of world I am creating for myself or where I want to live</h2><blockquote class="blockquote">FOR THE MOMENT I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN A SMALL STEP TOWARDS MY DESIRED WORLD<br><br>The biggest goal of the "My life" project is to first explain to myself how it is possible to live with less and easier effort. That is why I am stepping out of this comfortable daily exercise in life. If successful, I will also share my experiences from different fields. You can find more detailed information on my project page <a href="https://qortal://WEBSITE/iffi%20forest%20life">iffi forest life</a></blockquote><p>My world is a world of free, happy, friendly, caring and helpful people, where small communities or communes operate in a friendly manner and where they help each other without profiting or taking advantage of the species people.<br><br>In my world, there is no evil, anger, ego, greed, i.e. all negative energy(at the moment, unfortunately, this world is like this in the 21st century - quite on the edge of the abyss), evil, greed, meanness, exploitation of others for the sake of one's own well-being, forcing other people to act against their own will in order to achieve their own well-being and gain through it.</p><blockquote class="blockquote">I am a free man and decide and take responsibility for my own life, I currently have the best opportunity to create and fulfill my dreams of a good and positive world. I do exactly what I want, when I want and as much as I can. I do not recognize any fraudulently invented countries, much less their slavery laws.</blockquote><p>QORTAL came into my life like a gift from god and in terms of its possibilities, it fits exactly with the vision of my future life and the world. Here, I would like to thank all the creators of QORTAL from the bottom of my heart and the people working together here for a better future.<br><br>My plan is to create a community around me where people with positive thinking manage and act on a daily basis. People who can appreciate other people without material and financial wealth, who can appreciate a person's inner soul and wealth.<br>Who is willing to help each other, to be helpful with both strength and good thoughts. People who don't want to receive an immediate financial reward for their offered help or are also willing to exchange human energy! You can visit the website of the commune called <a href="https://qortal://WEBSITE/suomen vapaiden ihmisten kommuuni">SVIK</a><em>(web page in Finnish)</em></p><blockquote class="blockquote">In my opinion, QORTAL is a very, very good and the only solution for creating this whole community, which offers censorship-free online communication, trading and much, much more. Qortal has just enough of everything you need, there is no excess garbage<br></blockquote><p>In the same way, day by day I am also building my own new life here in the middle of the forest from scratch, that is, from the beginning. I am surrounded by a forest and neighbors a kilometer away, sometimes a week goes by without seeing a single person. The big center is tens of kilometers away from here. I have absolutely no monthly financial income. I have to be able to handle everything yourself and produce and grow it yourself. I produce my own electricity, grow my own food, etc.</p><blockquote class="blockquote">In my opinion, this is complete freedom and independence, every day when I wake up, I spend every second only for myself.</blockquote><hr class="separator separator--dots"><p class="msg msg--highlight">If necessary, I will supplement the given story at my discretion.
